    "### Density Study - Summary of Computations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Definition\n",
    "The density indicator measures the relative abundance of birds observed per transect and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Computation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Counting per Transect and Year**  \n",
    "From the cleaned observation dataset (`nom_francais_clean`), total bird counts were aggregated by `(year, transect)` using columns such as `TOT_A`, `TOT_V_sV`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) Normalization**  \n",
    "Each transect’s annual count was normalized by the maximum count observed across all years:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{density\\_norm}_{i,t} = \\frac{\\text{count}_{i,t}}{\\max(\\text{count}_{\\text{all years}})} $$\n",
    "Densities are thus scaled to the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Bootstrap Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "A bootstrap resampling method was used to estimate uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each year, resample transects with replacement \\( B \\) times (e.g. \\( B = 1000 \\)).\n",
    "2. Compute the mean normalized density for each resample.\n",
    "3. Obtain 95% confidence intervals from the empirical quantiles of the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = [\\hat{\\theta}^*_{2.5\\%}, \\hat{\\theta}^*_{97.5\\%}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Derived Indicators and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Annual mean normalized density computed and plotted over time.  \n",
    "- Per-year density distribution visualized by transect (color-coded).  \n",
    "- Temporal evolution of normalized densities visualized across transects.  \n",
    "- Bootstrap mean and confidence intervals plotted for density trends.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The density analysis provides a standardized way to compare bird abundance across\n",
    "years by accounting for variation in sampling effort. The initial density plots\n",
    "show clear differences in abundance between transects, reflecting environmental\n",
    "heterogeneity and habitat-specific suitability. When examining annual mean\n",
    "densities, we observe temporal fluctuations that suggest shifts in overall bird\n",
    "activity or detectability from year to year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap procedure adds statistical rigor by quantifying uncertainty around\n",
    "the estimated yearly densities. The resulting confidence intervals show how\n",
    "stable or variable these density estimates are over time. Narrow intervals\n",
    "indicate consistent sampling responses across transects, while wider intervals\n",
    "suggest greater spatial or temporal variability in bird presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitted regression trends allow us to determine whether density changes\n",
    "represent meaningful ecological patterns rather than random fluctuation. Where\n",
    "the regression slope is statistically significant, we can infer a directional\n",
    "trend—either increasing or declining density—over the study period. In contrast,\n",
    "non-significant slopes suggest that densities remain broadly stable, with\n",
    "year-to-year variation falling within the expected range of sampling variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the density plots, bootstrap confidence intervals, and regression\n",
    "analysis provide complementary evidence that allows us to evaluate not only the\n",
    "magnitude of density changes but also their reliability and ecological relevance.\n",
    "This integrated approach helps distinguish true shifts in bird community\n",
    "activity from random sampling fluctuation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Detectability Study (auditory V.S. visual)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Coverage Study (Explain why not intersting )\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Species-Level Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "We should explain the choice of our subset (top 5 most observed birds), and then the choice of indicators to study evolution. Here we should detail our methods for bootstrapping and choice of indexes \n",
    "\n",
    "### Abundance Evolution Study \n",
    "\n",
    "We use mean abundance instead of total number counted per year because:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sampling effort changes across years (number of transects visited, observers present, duration, weather conditions, etc.).\n",
    " - The total number of birds counted is therefore not directly comparable from year to year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the mean abundance standardizes for effort, making trends fair and comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trend Significance per Species\n",
    "\n",
    "For all this species except \"Quiscale merle\" , the slope is > 0 , so species abundance is increasing over time, but the only significant values are for \"Elénie siffleuse\" and \t\"Tourterelle à queue carrée\". \"Quiscale merle\" has also a significant negative value, so could suppose that the abundance is decreasing over the time, but the p-value is quite high. This suggests a possible decline, but evidence is weak. By looking at p-value (< 0.05), we can say that trend is statistically significant for \"Elénie siffleuse\" and \"Tourterelle à queue carrée\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Species-Specific Abundance Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "The figures above display the temporal evolution of abundance for the five most frequently recorded bird species in the dataset, using the standardized mean abundance (TOT_AV_V) per year and associated uncertainty estimated via bootstrap resampling. For **Élenie siffleuse**, the annual mean abundance shows a generally increasing pattern over the study period, and the fitted linear trend is positive with confidence intervals that do not overlap heavily with zero, indicating a statistically supported rise in abundance. A similar positive and statistically significant trend is observed for **Tourterelle à queue carrée**, where both the slope and the bootstrap confidence intervals suggest a sustained increase in occurrence intensity over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Quiscale merle** shows a declining fitted trend line, but the year-to-year variability is relatively high and the confidence intervals are broader, resulting in a non-significant trend. This suggests that although the species may be experiencing a reduction in recorded abundance, further data or more controlled sampling would be needed to confidently confirm this decline. For **Sporophile rougegorge** and **Sucrier à ventre jaune**, the mean abundance values fluctuate from year to year without displaying a marked directional change. Their fitted trends are near-flat and associated confidence intervals are wide, indicating that these populations have remained relatively stable across the studied period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results highlight two species experiencing significant increases (Élenie siffleuse and Tourterelle à queue carrée), one species with a possible but unconfirmed decline (Quiscale merle), and two species showing stable abundance levels with no evidence of directional long-term change (Sporophile rougegorge and Sucrier à ventre jaune).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-abundance and bootstrap approach provides a robust, effort-standardized indicator of species presence over time. However, this method does not explicitly correct for variation in detection probability (observer effects, weather, time of day), and assumes independence between sampling events, which may not always hold. Additionally, mean abundance reflects relative observation rates rather than absolute population sizes, because mean abundance is how often the species are recorded, not how many individuals exist in the ecosystem., and the linear trend model may not capture non-linear ecological dynamics. Therefore, while the approach reliably identifies broad directional changes, results should be interpreted as population indices rather than direct population estimates.\n",
