    "first steps motivations :\n",
    "- Check schema consistency with df.info() and df.head().\n",
    "- Validate effort assumptions – confirm each transect has 10 points, look for sites with fewer than - 10 completed visits, and note detection modality distributions.\n",
    "- Create orientation summaries – species richness by site, observer workload, yearly totals,   detection modality shares.\n",

    "- Dataset Familiarisation and Descriptive Analysis : data structure, descriptive statistics \n",
    "- Multi-Year Indicator Trends : Select indicators, for each compute annual estimates, quantify and interpret temporal trends (maybe linear models)\n",
    "- Species-Level Evolution  : choose subset of birds, for each specie analyse how its recorded presence have changed (CI), potential reasons ? \n",

    "| Sheet name | Problem in raw data |\n",
    "|------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| `ESPECES`  | The raw data sheet jumped the two first columns in the excel sheet, it had no headers and one single NaN on the last column |\n",
    "| `GPS-MILIEU` | The raw data sheet jumped the two first columns, it had no prescence of NaNs. The headers were wrongly placed due to a double leveled header for geographical coordinates and last 3 columns didn't had headers.   |\n",
    "| `NOM FRANÇAIS` | The original sheet had 26 columns but the last one was \"hidden\" (first values started a couple thounsand rows in). Headers were missplaced due to a triple and double leveled headers from columns 13 to 25 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to correct this problems we proposed a 2 step solution, first we dropped the redundant columuns (in ESPECES ans GPS-MILIEU) and then we redefined the headers of the 3 sheets as listed next : \n",

    "| Sheet name | New headers |\n",
    "|------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| `ESPECES`  | \"ESPECIES_NAME\", \"LATIN_NAME\", \"NATURE\" |\n",

    "In the case of `NOM FRANÇAIS` only headers from columns 13 to 25 were changed following a patern that we stablished : \\\n",
    "For columns 13 to 20 (distances de contact) we stablished a 3 part code, the first letter (A or V) is for Auditif or Visuel, the second letter (L or G) is for \"<\" or \">\" and finally the number corresponds to the distance in meters.\\\n",
    "For columns 22 to 25 (totaux) a simalar approach was used, the first section has one or two letters (A, V or AV) for \"Auditif\", \"Visuel\" or \"A+V\", the second sections has two different entries (sV or V) for \"sans Vol\" or \"avec Vol\"\n",

    "### Density Study - Summary of Computations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Definition\n",
    "The density indicator measures the relative abundance of birds observed per transect and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Computation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Counting per Transect and Year**  \n",
    "From the cleaned observation dataset (`nom_francais_clean`), total bird counts were aggregated by `(year, transect)` using columns such as `TOT_A`, `TOT_V_sV`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) Normalization**  \n",
    "Each transect’s annual count was normalized by the maximum count observed across all years:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{density\\_norm}_{i,t} = \\frac{\\text{count}_{i,t}}{\\max(\\text{count}_{\\text{all years}})} $$\n",
    "Densities are thus scaled to the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Bootstrap Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "A bootstrap resampling method was used to estimate uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each year, resample transects with replacement \\( B \\) times (e.g. \\( B = 1000 \\)).\n",
    "2. Compute the mean normalized density for each resample.\n",
    "3. Obtain 95% confidence intervals from the empirical quantiles of the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = [\\hat{\\theta}^*_{2.5\\%}, \\hat{\\theta}^*_{97.5\\%}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Derived Indicators and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Annual mean normalized density computed and plotted over time.  \n",
    "- Per-year density distribution visualized by transect (color-coded).  \n",
    "- Temporal evolution of normalized densities visualized across transects.  \n",
