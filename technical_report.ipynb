It is to be seen if the final technical report will be written as an .md or a pdf

NOTE : 30/10/2025

### Next steps to take in consideration 

**Overview.md**\
first steps motivations :
- Check schema consistency with df.info() and df.head().
- Validate effort assumptions – confirm each transect has 10 points, look for sites with fewer than - 10 completed visits, and note detection modality distributions.
- Create orientation summaries – species richness by site, observer workload, yearly totals,   detection modality shares.

**Assignment.pdf**\
Goal :  To quantify how biodiversity indicatiors have evolved over time. With statistical uncertainity assessments, highlighting species-specific stories. 

Big points to treat : 
- Dataset Familiarisation and Descriptive Analysis : data structure, descriptive statistics 
- Multi-Year Indicator Trends : Select indicators, for each compute annual estimates, quantify and interpret temporal trends (maybe linear models)
- Species-Level Evolution  : choose subset of birds, for each specie analyse how its recorded presence have changed (CI), potential reasons ?

## Initial approach, data discovery 
First problems encountered : Intial reading and separation of the raw data. 

| Sheet name | Problem in raw data |
|------------|---------------------|
| `ESPECES`  | The raw data sheet jumped the two first columns in the excel sheet, it had no headers and one single NaN on the last column |
| `GPS-MILIEU` | The raw data sheet jumped the two first columns, it had no prescence of NaNs. The headers were wrongly placed due to a double leveled header for geographical coordinates and last 3 columns didn't had headers.   |
| `NOM FRANÇAIS` | The original sheet had 26 columns but the last one was "hidden" (first values started a couple thounsand rows in). Headers were missplaced due to a triple and double leveled headers from columns 13 to 25 |

In order to correct this problems we proposed a 2 step solution, first we dropped the redundant columuns (in ESPECES ans GPS-MILIEU) and then we redefined the headers of the 3 sheets as listed next : 

| Sheet name | New headers |
|------------|---------------------|
| `ESPECES`  | "ESPECIES_NAME", "LATIN_NAME", "NATURE" |
| `GPS-MILIEU` |   "TRANSECT_NAME", "COORDINATE_X", "COORDINATE_Y", "HABITAT_TYPE","TRANSECT_ID", "POINT_ID",  |
| `NOM FRANÇAIS` | (Col 13 to 26) : "AL25", "VL25", "AL50", "VL50", "AL100", "VL100", "AG100", "VG100", "VOL", "TOT_A", "TOT_V_sV", "TOT_AV_sV", "TOT_AV_V", "COMPANIED", |

In the case of `NOM FRANÇAIS` only headers from columns 13 to 25 were changed following a patern that we stablished : \
For columns 13 to 20 (distances de contact) we stablished a 3 part code, the first letter (A or V) is for Auditif or Visuel, the second letter (L or G) is for "<" or ">" and finally the number corresponds to the distance in meters.\
For columns 22 to 25 (totaux) a simalar approach was used, the first section has one or two letters (A, V or AV) for "Auditif", "Visuel" or "A+V", the second sections has two different entries (sV or V) for "sans Vol" or "avec Vol"

**This new sheets were saved in "data/cleaned"**

# Story telling 

## 1. Dataset Familiarisation and Descriptive Analysis 

- **Cleaning** : Talk about all the incoherences, initial problems and how we treat them in utils.py 
- **Familarisation** : Quick glance at all the initial statistical analysis (one for each of the 3 intial tabs) and give first key insights

Here we can explain the dropped columns and the new headers names, ...

## 2. Multi-Year Indicator Trends
Here we should explain in detail all the Indicator's choices, how did we treat them and the conclusions 

### Density Study - Summary of Computations

#### 1. Definition
The density indicator measures the relative abundance of birds observed per transect and year.

#### 2. Computation Steps

**(a) Counting per Transect and Year**  
From the cleaned observation dataset (`nom_francais_clean`), total bird counts were aggregated by `(year, transect)` using columns such as `TOT_A`, `TOT_V_sV`, etc.

**(b) Normalization**  
Each transect’s annual count was normalized by the maximum count observed across all years:

$$ \text{density\_norm}_{i,t} = \frac{\text{count}_{i,t}}{\max(\text{count}_{\text{all years}})} $$
Densities are thus scaled to the range [0, 1].

#### 3. Bootstrap Estimation

A bootstrap resampling method was used to estimate uncertainty:

1. For each year, resample transects with replacement \( B \) times (e.g. \( B = 1000 \)).
2. Compute the mean normalized density for each resample.
3. Obtain 95% confidence intervals from the empirical quantiles of the bootstrap distribution.

$$ \text{CI}_{95\%} = [\hat{\theta}^*_{2.5\%}, \hat{\theta}^*_{97.5\%}] $$

#### 4. Derived Indicators and Visualization

- Annual mean normalized density computed and plotted over time.  
- Per-year density distribution visualized by transect (color-coded).  
- Temporal evolution of normalized densities visualized across transects.  
- Bootstrap mean and confidence intervals plotted for density trends.
  
### Species Diversity Study

### Detectability Study (auditory V.S. visual)

### Spatial Coverage Study (Explain why not intersting )

## 3. Species-Level Evolution

We should explain the choice of our subset (top 5 most observed birds), and then the choice of indicators to study evolution. Here we should detail our methods for bootstrapping and choice of indexes 

### Abundance Evolution Study 

### Per-Transect Detection Rate Evolution Study 

## 4. Synthesis 

Conclusions
