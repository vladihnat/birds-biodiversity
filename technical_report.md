# Birds Biodiversity Technical report

It is to be seen if the final technical report will be written as an .md or a pdf


NOTE 29/10/2025 : The first 2 tables (ESPECES and GPS-MILIEU) are clean and save without reading issues. Now we must clean the third "dfs['NOM FRANÃ‡AIS']" which has problems between the columns 12 and 20 (inclusive) were the headers are confused as data rows, possible solution re-write the headers for "distances de contact" as code of 3 parts (A or V for audio or visuel)(L or G for \< or \> (Num), same idea for Totaux but adding suffixe TOT_. E.g : AL25, VL25, AL50...AG100...
